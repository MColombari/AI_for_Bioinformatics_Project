# AI_for_Bioinformatics_Project

### Objective
This repository explores the correlation between gene expression, methylation and copy number with respect to the OS (Overall Survival) of a cancer patient, more specifically an ovarian cancer patient.


To explore this we use different types of Deep Learning model, and we represent the data with a graph structure.


More information about this project and its results are available in the following [paper].

### Repository structure
- **GGNN**: External repository from the following paper, [A Gemetric informed Graph neural network based model for Cancer survival prediction](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107117).
- **GNN_Classification**: External repository from [link](https://github.com/bknyaz/graph_nn).
- **Preprocessing**: preprocessing of input data and creation of relevant files used during training, in this folder we tested different methods to apply the preproces, a final version for the preprocessing can be observed in the "Training" folder.
- **Training**: actual training.
