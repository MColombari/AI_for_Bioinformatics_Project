### Repository structure

- **Methylation**: Preprocessing of Methylation.
- **Gene**: Preprocessing of Gene, and script to generate essential files for the training, more information is provided in the README file inside.
- **_preprocessing.ipynb_**: jupyter notebook used to create essential json file for the Train, such as:
    - **_case_id_intersection_white_list.json_**: case id list which has data for Gene expression, Methylation and Copy number.
    - **_case_id_and_structure.json_**: complete json structure where we save for each case id, the OS, and the relative Gene expression, Methylation and Copy number files.
- **_gene_id_protein_coding.json_**: this file is generated by the jupyter notebook Gene/Preprocessing_Gene.ipynb, and contains the list of all the protein coding genes, extracted from the GTF file ("gencode.v47.annotation.gtf"), this file is also provided in the drive.
- **_preview_test_and_train_ipynb_**: jupyter notebook used to create graphs about train and test distribution.
