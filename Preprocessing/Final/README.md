### Repository structure

- CNV_preprocessing: Preprocessing of copy number.
- Methylation: Preprocessing of Methylation.
- Gene: Preprocessing of Gene, and script to generate essential file for the training, more information are provided in the README file inside.
- preprocessing.ipynb: jupyter notebook used to create essential json file for the Train, such as:
    - case_id_intersection_white_list: case id list which have data for Gene expression, Methylation and Copy number.
    - case_id_and_structure: complete json structure where we save for each case id, the OS, and the relative Gene expression, Methylation and Copy number files.
- gene_id_protein_coding: this file is generated by the jupyter notebook Gene/Preprocessing_Gene.ipynb, and contains the list of all the protein coding genes, extracted from the GTF file ("gencode.v47.annotation.gtf"), this file is also provided in the drive.
