What to do next:
- Redo the preprocessing.
    - Take only the 20k gene about proteine coding.
        - Information in .gts.
    - So first get only the dead one.
    - Then save corresponging relative data, like OS, and files name.
- Procede with next data preprocessing, so normalization and such.

- how to apply normalization:
    - Gene expression.
        - log in base 10, plus a small constant, like "0.01".
        - Then normalize "[0,1]", "[-1,1]".
    - Methylation.
        - See how many row we have and eventually cut some based on gene, keep only around 27k.
    - Copy number.
